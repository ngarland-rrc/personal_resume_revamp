# Reflection

## 1. Can I explain what my code does?

My code formats my resume information in a structured and readable webpage.
With formatting it into sections it allows the reader to easily find the
information they need to know about me.

## 2. What was my coding process?

To help plan and organize my project I first looked over the example page
given to give me an idea of the structure of the webpage. After that I
structured my project into multiple sections that I thought I would need
and added more through out when needed. I also made sure to create an image
folder to keep my images organized and separate from the main file.

## 3. What challenges did I have?

I think the main obstacle I faced was more on the information side of things,
for example I don't really have much experience or any completed projects
so finding information to do the file was a bit challenging.

## 4. What would I do differently now?

I think I would try to gather as much information I needed for the project
before starting the code as well as gathering any media I wanted before hand,
saving time trying to search up things in the middle of coding it.
